                <li><img src="/Pictures/Dwarkadhish-Temple.jpg" alt="Dwarkadhish Temple" ><h4>Dwarkadhish Temple</h4>Dwarka on the western tip of the Kathiawar Peninsula is clubbed with the holiest sites in India â€“ the Char Dhams that include Badrinath, Puri and Rameshwaram. It is believed that Lord Krishna arrived here from Braj in Uttar Pradesh to build the city. The temple was established by his grandson. It is at the cusp of the Gomti River and the Arabian Sea, providing a scenic backdrop to the spiritual site. It is said that Dwarka was submerged under the sea six times and what we see now is its seventh avatar. The temple itself has a fascinating legend. The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th-16th century. It was also feted by Adi Shankaracharya, the 8th century Hindu theologian and philosopher.</li>
